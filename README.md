# hideN's MP3 Downloader
### This is a simple terminal MP3 Downloader solution that is based on the `yt-dlp` repository and has a freeze.py file with `py2exe` build instructions. The program creates all the needed files but you still need to download FFmpeg for everything to work.

### Usage
This tool works with a multitude amount of websites, you just have to place the link of the video/audio file and it downloads it.
Playlists are detected automatically on websites such as YouTube, Bandcamp, etc. and the program will download the audio files one after another.
### Build

Use the `python freeze.py` command after you cd into the 'master' folder.
